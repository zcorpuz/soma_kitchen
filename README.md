## About the Project
This website is developed for our client, Law Offices of Theodore A. Behlendorf, based in Los Angeles, CA. We were asked to build a website that is easy-to-read but that is also presentable to any client who comes across this site. It includes a home page, an about page, and a contact page. 

The reason we chose to partner with this client is because they were interested in increasing their online presence, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. They knew they would not receive the same number of in-person clientele, so they wanted to establish a platform where they would connect to their clientele virtually. 

This application is responsive, where no matter what the screen size is (or device used), the application would still be presentable to the user. 

### Demo
This is the demo of the website: https://protected-everglades-09109.herokuapp.com/.


### Landing Page
This is how the site will look like when:

* opened on a desktop:
